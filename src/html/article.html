                          <p class="blog-card-description">At the end of my second year of college I needed to do an internship of 6 weeklong. 
                              I had the chance of doing it at parametry.ai in Germany, which is a small start-up about machine learning and 
                              space operation. Right now, parametry.ai has 3 different projects:<br>
                            -	a cloud server which stock data for other company.<br>
                            -	A blockchains project to keep track of the satellite and the mission<br>
                            -	Polaris which is an open-source project to apply machine learning to satellite telemetry.
                            Which was the project I work on during my stay<br>
                            The idee of Polaris his to use the machine learning to lesser the amount of data receives by the
                             satellite operator.<br>  
                            Ok that’s great but what hell does this mean?<br>
                            Well, the way satellite works now days is basic. 
                            You have your different component of your satellite that give and receive information 
                            from the other component or their instrument. So, the satellite has a huge amount of data 
                            going in and out and all this data is sent back to the operators which normally,
                             only 1 or 2 out of the 5 guys truly know the satellite and how the satellite is supposed to work.<br><br>
                            We are using algorithms to try to reduce the among of data and to pint point the source of the probleme.
